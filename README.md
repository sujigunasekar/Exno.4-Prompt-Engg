# Exno.3-Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230152
### Aim:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

## Algorithm: 

## 1. Direct Instruction Prompts
### Objective: Guide the chatbot to respond concisely to customer inquiries.

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt:
"When a customer asks for the status of their order, reply with: 'Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].'"

## 2. Contextual Prompting

Objective: Incorporate specific context to provide detailed answers based on the user‚Äôs previous interaction.

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt: 
"If the customer previously mentioned that they haven‚Äôt received their order, say, 'I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.'"

## 3. Persona-Based Prompting

### Objective: Design the chatbot to adopt a specific persona, making the interaction more engaging.

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt: 
"Pretend you are a friendly, helpful customer service representative. Use a conversational tone, such as 'Hey there! I‚Äôm here to help with any questions you might have. Let‚Äôs get your issue sorted!'"

## 4. Few-Shot Prompting

### Objective: Teach the AI how to respond using a few examples, enabling it to generalize for similar situations.

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt: 
"Here are some examples of how to handle technical questions:

'My phone isn't charging.' ‚Üí 'Have you tried using a different cable? If that doesn‚Äôt work, it may be an issue with the port.'
'The screen is flickering.' ‚Üí 'It sounds like a display issue. Have you tried restarting the device?'

Now, respond to: 'My app keeps crashing.'"

## 5. Chain of Thought Prompting

### Objective: Use a step-by-step reasoning approach for resolving more complex or technical issues.

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt: "When a customer reports their laptop overheating, guide them through the following steps:

Ask if they are using the laptop on a soft surface.

Suggest moving the laptop to a flat, hard surface for better airflow.

Ask if they‚Äôve cleaned the vents recently.

Recommend restarting the device to see if the issue persists.

Now, solve: 'My laptop fan is making a loud noise.'"

## 6. Instruction with Constraints

### Objective: Instruct the chatbot to provide assistance while adhering to specific constraints (e.g., response length or tone).

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt:
"Respond to order inquiries in no more than 50 words and avoid using technical jargon. For example, 'Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date]. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.'"

## 7. Reflective Prompting

### Objective: Ensure that the chatbot reflects the user‚Äôs query back to them before providing a response, reducing misunderstandings.

### Prompt Pattern:

### Prompt:
"When a customer asks for help, first reflect their question back to them. For example, if they ask 'How can I reset my password?' respond with 'You're asking how to reset your password, correct? Here‚Äôs how you can do it.'"

Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully.
### 1. Direct Instruction Prompt
#### Prompt:
"When a customer asks about delivery status, respond with:
'Your delivery is on its way and should arrive by [date]. Let us know if you need anything else.'"
| Tool       | Output                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini** | "Your delivery is on its way and should arrive by May 17th. Let us know if you need anything else."      |
| **Cohere** | "Your order is en route and will be delivered by May 17. If you have questions, feel free to reach out." |
‚úÖ Both tools provide accurate, direct answers with slightly varied wording. Cohere adds a slightly more formal tone.

### 2. Contextual Prompting
#### Prompt:

"If the customer already mentioned their item was delayed, respond with:
'I understand you‚Äôve experienced a delay. Let me review your order and provide an updated ETA.'"
| Tool       | Output                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini** | "I understand you‚Äôve experienced a delay. Let me review your order and provide an updated ETA."          |
| **Cohere** | "Thanks for your patience. I see you've faced a delay‚ÄîI'll check your order now and update you shortly." |
‚úÖ Gemini sticks to instructions exactly. Cohere offers a slightly more conversational variation while maintaining context.

### 3. Persona-Based Prompting
#### Prompt:

"Act like a cheerful and friendly support assistant. Say something like:
'Hi there! üòä I‚Äôm here to help with anything you need. Let‚Äôs solve this together!'"
| Tool       | Output                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini** | "Hi there! üòä I‚Äôm here to help with anything you need. Let‚Äôs solve this together‚Äîwhat can I assist you with today?" |
| **Cohere** | "Hey! üòÑ So glad you reached out. Let‚Äôs figure this out together‚Äîwhat can I do for you today?"                      |
‚úÖ Gemini stays close to the original tone. Cohere adds more personality and informal warmth, making it feel more human.

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting
#### Prompt:
Examples:

"My laptop isn't turning on." ‚Üí "Try holding the power button for 10 seconds. If that doesn‚Äôt work, check your charger."

"The printer is offline." ‚Üí "Restart your printer and reconnect it to Wi-Fi."

Now respond to:
"My mouse isn‚Äôt responding."
| Tool       | Output                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini** | "Try reconnecting the mouse or replacing the battery if it's wireless. Also, check the USB port or Bluetooth settings." |
| **Cohere** | "Make sure the mouse is turned on. If it‚Äôs wireless, try new batteries. If wired, try another USB port."                |
‚úÖ Both tools successfully apply example logic. Gemini is slightly more technical, while Cohere offers clearer steps for general users.
